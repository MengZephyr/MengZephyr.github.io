I am an associate professor at school of computer science and engineering, [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/), China. Before that, I had three years (from 2019.8 to 2022.7) working with [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/index.html) as a PostDoc researcher in [Smart Geometry Processing Group](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people.php), University College London. I got my PhD degree (in 2019) from Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Kun Zhou](http://kunzhou.net/). I received my Bachelor’s degree (in 2010) and Master’s degree (in 2013) from School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University. My research interests are in computer graphics, with a recent focus on applying deep learning to dynamic modeling, rendering, and editing. My work mainly lies in hair modeling, garment simulation and animation.
