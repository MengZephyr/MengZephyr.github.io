## Abstract
Digital Salon is a revolutionary tool for 3D hair grooming and simulation, integrating AI and physics-based algorithms to simplify hair modeling, animation, and rendering. It enables users to generate detailed hairstyles through natural language descriptions. This tool combines text-based hair creation, interactive editing, and high-quality rendering into a unified pipeline. Digital Salon’s innovative real-time simulation and versatile capabilities allow for the dynamic representation of various hair types and interactions with support for 10,000 to 80,000 strands, making advanced hair design accessible to users of all skill levels and dramatically streamlining the creative process in digital media.
