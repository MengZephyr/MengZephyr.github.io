I just start my faculty position as an associate professor in the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Systems for High-Dimensional Information of Ministry of Education, [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/), China. Before that, I had three years (from 2019.8 to 2022.7) working with [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/index.html) as a PostDoc researcher in [Smart Geometry Processing Group](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people.php), University College London. I got my PhD degree (in 2019) from Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Kun Zhou](http://kunzhou.net/). I received my Bachelor’s degree (in 2010) and Master’s degree (in 2013) from School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University. My research focuses on deep learning, 3D shaping and animation, image-based modeling, texture mapping and synthesis, style learning and transfer.
