I got my PhD degree (in 2019) from Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Kun Zhou](http://kunzhou.net/). I received my Bachelor’s degree (in 2010) and Master’s degree (in 2013) from School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University. 

I'm interested in Deep Learning, 3D shape capture and reconstruction, image-based modeling, texture mapping and synthesis.
