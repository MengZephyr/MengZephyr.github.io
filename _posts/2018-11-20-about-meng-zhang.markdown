I am a PostDoc Associate Research in [Smart Geometry Processing Group](https://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php), University College London, under the supervision of [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/index.html). I got my PhD degree (in 2019) from Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Kun Zhou](http://kunzhou.net/). I received my Bachelor’s degree (in 2010) and Master’s degree (in 2013) from School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University. My research focuses on deep learning, 3D shape capture and reconstruction, image-based modeling, texture mapping and synthesis, style learning and transfer.
