I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Graphics & Parallel Systems Lab(GAPS), Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Kun Zhou. I received my Bachelor’s degree (in 2010) and Master’s degree (in 2013) from School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University. My research focuses on 3D shape capture, 3D reconstruction, image-based modeling, texture mapping and synthesis.
